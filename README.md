For this project, I utilized HTML and CSS to create an expandable, professional portfolio for 
all the web developement projects I complete, both in the course I am taking through Michigan
State University, and beyond. 

I also utilized a few different scripts to achieve the transitions I wanted to implement that
would see content fade in and out on scroll.
